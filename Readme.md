## How to use the API

The API uses JWT for Authentication, so you need to use the superuser credentials you created above to authenticate the api on postman or insomnia. Then copy the access_token to your postman/insomnia environment to make subsequent authenticated request to the create_cycles and cycle_event end_point.

The screenshot below shows The endpoints and body required and expected JSON response
